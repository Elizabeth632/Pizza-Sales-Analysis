# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

### This project is a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data aimed at uncovering key insights that can drive business decisions.
By leveraging SQL, various queries are executed to explore different aspects of the data, such as 
* Average revenue,
* Sales trends across different pizza sizes,
* Monthly performance.
   The analysis also highlights the most popular pizza categories, identifies the highest revenue-generating orders, and examines the overall time span of the recorded sales.

  This data-driven approach provides a foundation for optimizing sales strategies, inventory management, and customer satisfaction in the pizza industry.
